# s3lurp - Browser Uploads Direct to S3

direct s3 upload Rails form helper

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 's3lurp'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install s3lurp

### Configuration

S3lurp has many options that can be configured globally or passed
to the helper via a hash.

#### AWS S3 Setup

There are three options required for buckets that are not public-write:

* `s3_bucket` - The name of the bucket where files go
* `aws_access_key` - This is your AWS Access Key ID
* `aws_secret_key` - Your AWS Secret Accss Key


These three options can be set via a yaml config file, an initializer, or ENV vars.


    ENV['S3_BUCKET']
    ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY']
    ENV['AWS_SECRET_KEY']

Another way to set up these options is to us an initializer.

In config/initializers/s3lurp.rb

```ruby
S3lurp.configure do |config|
  config.s3_bucket = "bucket_of_holding"
  config.aws_access_key = "some_acces_key"
  config.aws_secret_key = "keep_it_secret"
```

Finally you can use use a yaml file to load the configuration.

```ruby
# config/initializers/s3lurp.rb
S3lurp.congigure do |config|
  config.file = 's3lurp.yml'
end
# config/s3lurp.yml
development:
  s3_bucket: "dev_bucket"
  aws_access_key: "dev_key"
  aws_secret_key: "dev_secret"
production:
  s3_bucket: "prod_bucket"
  aws_access_key: "prod_key"
  aws_secret_key: "prod_secret"
```

Using a yaml conifg file allows you to use different settings for different
environments. Note: It's not necessary to provide environment based settings. The
yaml can just be a set of key/value pairs without any grouping by environment.

#### S3lurp Config Example

Here is an exmaple of how to configure s3lurp using Heroku.

Setup your ENV variables for heroku and for local use.
For more on Heroku config see here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars

```
$ heroku config:add AWS_ACCESS_KEY=asdfg12345 AWS_SECRET=qwertyu0987622`
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=asdfg12345
$ export AWS_SECRET=qwertyu0987622
```

Set up some defaults with an initialzer

```ruby
# config/initializers/s3lurp.rb
S3lurp.congigure do |config|
  config.acl = 'public-read'
  config.minutes_valid = '600'
  config.max_file_size = 10.megabytes
  config.min_file_size = 1024
end
```

And now in your view you can call

    s3_direct_form_tag({:key => 'photos/uuid/${filename}'})

This will generate a complete form with a file input and a submit tag. The form
will contain all the necessary hidden fields to perform a direct upload to S3.

#### Configuration Options

Many of these options correspond to the HTML form fields that AWS accepts. This documentation will
be helpful: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HTTPPOSTForms.html

All of these can be congured in an initializer, a yaml config file, or passed directly
to the helper in a hash.
